The name of the show is very inappropriate. Panchali is actually is a very pious goddess in Hinduism. But this series attempts to insult her. This series must he banned. The commies always try to spread hate speech. They dont know about the eternal and most developed religion- Hinduism.;Panchali was called panchali because she was princess of Panchal kingdom. It is nothing to do with multiple man. Secondly she was married with customes to all her five husband and was following strict rules of grahasth ashram. However this is serious attempt to distory her virtue, she respesent all of the lady and for the sake of her respect , pandav fight Mahabharata. Please please stop naming stupid rubbish seeial after pious names .;This was supposed to be a series but might be shelved after just one episode.  In the first episode there was nothing, there is some intimate scenes which fails to arouse.  Aman Verma was ok. Anupriya Goenka is stunningly beautiful and rest cast is just ok. Avoid if you can.
